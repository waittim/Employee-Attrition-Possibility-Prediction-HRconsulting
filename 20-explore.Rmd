## Basic exploration

We will not be performing exploratory data analysis due to time constraints

```{r}
attrition %>%
  mutate(annual_salary = 2080 * hourly_rate,
         replace_cost = if_else(attrition == "Yes", replace_multiplier * annual_salary, 0)) %>%
  summarize(total_cost = sum(replace_cost))
```
```{r}
attrition %>%
  tabyl(attrition)
```
